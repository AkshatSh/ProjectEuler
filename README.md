Each Problem has its own folder with a java file titled solution. The problem statements are as follows:


Problem 1 : Multiples of 3 and 5
====
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Problem 2 : Even Fibonnaci Numbers
====
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Problem 67: Max Path sum
====

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3

7 4

2 4 6

8 5 9 3


That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt , a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
